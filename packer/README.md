# Overview
This demo uses Packer to create an Azure managed image and publish it to an Azure Shared Image Gallery using Packer and InSpec.

Packer uses a RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.3 image as its base and installs `httpd`, `git`, and `ansible`. It then runs InSpec to perform a simple test and outputs the test results in JUnit format.
